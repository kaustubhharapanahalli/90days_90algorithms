# 90 Days 90 Algorithms
This repository is about checking the commitment towards writing at least one algorithm or data structure related code.

This is to challenge myself to check if I can solve algorithms for 90 days continuously without taking a break on even a single day.

The main focus is on learning **Algorithms and Data Structures** in 90 days.
To do so, I'm referring each and every algorithm that is available on **GeeksforGeeks** as of now. Next I'm going to focus on Hackerrank Problems.
